A quick and Easy UserScript I made to pracise my JS skills.

[Install IMStreamDB](https://github.com/ZombieTaco/IMStreamDB/raw/master/code.user.js)

Adds a ``Stream`` button on any IMDB page.

Feel free to use your own, or the provided ``API_KEY`` - but it may be banned/rate limited in the future.

Requires use of either ``GreaseMoneky`` or ``TamperMonkey``

Known Issues:
  - Older IMDB pages do not have the div where the iframe is loaded
  - Openload or the stream crawler, has coinhive and other ads running which may be detected (**only shows 10% of the time, but almost always fails to load**) with your AV. I am looking at a solution to fix this.
